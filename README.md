# Simple-Scientific-Calculator
A command-line scientific calculator built in Python. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on multiple numbers, as well as trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh) and power operations. It features a simple.

A versatile command-line interface (CLI) scientific calculator developed in Python. Designed for simplicity and functionality, this tool allows users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations directly from the terminal.  

Features: 
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two or more numbers.
Trigonometry: Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent for angles in degrees, as well as their hyperbolic counterparts (sinh, cosh, tanh).
Power Operations: Easily calculate $x^y$ for any base $x$ and power $y$.User-Friendly 
Menu: An intuitive, numbered menu system for selecting the desired operation.
Error Handling: Includes try-except blocks to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.
